# braille-six-key-input
A repository for Braille six key input or Perkins braille concept using QWERTY keyboard in Python

Braille six key input or Perkins Braille uses 6 set of keys, one for each dot in a braille cell.
To type in braille, use SDFJKL keys only in keyboard (best if keyboard has N-key rollover feature).
Different combinations of SDFJKL keys gives different braille code.
Each key combinations must be pressed and released together at once.

F = dot-1, D = dot-2, S = dot-3, J = dot-4, K = dot-5, L = dot-6.

Hit Return key on keyboard to display typed braille code with its corresponding translation, or click the green button.
Based on grade 1 braille.
For extra, backspace is included to delete each braille code like deleting normal letter.
For extra, spacebar is included to add gap between each word like normal text does.
Make sure GUI window is in focus for key binding to work (best if the small textbox is tapped 1st b4 start typing)
